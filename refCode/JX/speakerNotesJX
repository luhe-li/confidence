All my experiment code should be on the mac in the testing room.

## Arduino:
There's a folder called Arduino_code. The code you want is Speaker_setup_3_24final. No need to change anything there. 

## Matlab:
Matlab code is in a folder called Experiment_code. If you only want auditory, check out the 2_unimodalLocSeq. If you want auditory-visual, check out the 3_bimodalLocUnity. There's a script called speakerPretest in 3_bimodalLocUnity that's worth checking out as well, for testing the speakers. If you want to make changes to the code, please make a copy of the code and then make changes. 

I attached the arduino code and the speakerPretest code here, these might be the most useful for you now. I'm not 100% sure if the speakerPretest script runs with no error, it's been a while since I looked at it. If this one doesn't work, the 3_bimodalLocUnity code should work for sure. 

PS. In my code, I have 31 auditory locations, which means for an auditory location that's in between two physical speakers, I turn on the two adjacent speakers and set them to 50% (perceptually) volumn, so it sounds like it's in the middle. Just weighted average basically.
