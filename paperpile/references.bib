              Some effort has thus been dedicated to offer different

              interactive nature of perceptual and causal inference. Further,
              observers assigned comparable perceptual and causal confidence to

              their causal and perceptual metamers on McGurk trials (i.e.

              Importantly, we tested the impact of the low- and high-energy

              Despite being irrelevant to the auditory task, both visual

              correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson's r) or its variant to

              variability on confidence and accuracy, dependence of confidence
              ratings on simultaneous or sequential reports of choice and

  abstract = "Decisions vary in difficulty. Humans know this and typically
              report more confidence in easy than in difficult decisions.
              However, confidence reports do not perfectly track decision
              accuracy, but also reflect response biases and difficulty
              misjudgements. To isolate the quality of confidence reports, we
              developed a model of the decision-making process underlying
              choice-confidence data. In this model, confidence reflects a
              subject's estimate of the reliability of their decision. The
              quality of this estimate is limited by the subject's uncertainty
              about the uncertainty of the variable that informs their decision
              ('meta-uncertainty'). This model provides an accurate account of
              choice-confidence data across a broad range of perceptual and
              cognitive tasks, investigated in six previous studies. We find
              meta-uncertainty varies across subjects, is stable over time,
              generalizes across some domains and can be manipulated
              experimentally. The model offers a parsimonious explanation for
              the computational processes that underlie and constrain the sense

  abstract = "On a daily basis, humans interact with the outside world using
              judgments of sensorimotor confidence, constantly evaluating our
              actions for success. We ask, what sensory and motor-execution
              cues are used in making these judgements and when are they
              available? Two sources of temporally distinct information are
              prospective cues, available prior to the action (e.g., knowledge
              of motor noise and past performance), and retrospective cues
              specific to the action itself (e.g., proprioceptive
              measurements). We investigated the use of these two cues in two
              tasks, a secondary motor-awareness task and a main task in which
              participants reached toward a visual target with an unseen hand
              and then made a continuous judgment of confidence about the
              success of the reach. Confidence was reported by setting the size
              of a circle centered on the reach-target location, where a larger
              circle reflects lower confidence. Points were awarded if the
              confidence circle enclosed the true endpoint, with fewer points
              returned for larger circles. This incentivized accurate reaches
              and attentive reporting to maximize the score. We compared three
              Bayesian-inference models of sensorimotor confidence based on
              either prospective cues, retrospective cues, or both sources of
              information to maximize expected gain (i.e., an ideal-performance
              model). Our findings primarily showed two distinct strategies:
              participants either performed as ideal observers, using both
              prospective and retrospective cues to make the confidence
              judgment, or relied solely on prospective information, ignoring
              retrospective cues. Thus, participants can make use of
              retrospective cues, evidenced by the behavior observed in our
              motor-awareness task, but these cues are not always included in
              the computation of sensorimotor confidence.",

              for decision making under uncertainty and time pressure. In the
              context of perceptual decision making, these models typically
              start with two input units, organized in a neuron-antineuron
              pair. In contrast, in the brain, sensory inputs are encoded
              through the activity of large neuronal populations. Moreover,
              while DDMs are wired by hand, the nervous system must learn the
              weights of the network through trial and error. There is
              currently no normative theory of learning in DDMs and therefore
              no theory of how decision makers could learn to make optimal
              decisions in this context. Here, we derive such a rule for
              learning a near-optimal linear combination of DDM inputs based on
              trial-by-trial feedback. The rule is Bayesian in the sense that
              it learns not only the mean of the weights but also the
              uncertainty around this mean in the form of a covariance matrix.
              In this rule, the rate of learning is proportional (respectively,
              inversely proportional) to confidence for incorrect
              (respectively, correct) decisions. Furthermore, we show that, in
              volatile environments, the rule predicts a bias toward repeating
              the same choice after correct decisions, with a bias strength
              that is modulated by the previous choice's difficulty. Finally,
              we extend our learning rule to cases for which one of the choices
              is more likely a priori, which provides insights into how such

              unite decision accuracy, speed, and confidence in a common
              framework of bounded evidence accumulation, furnishing a platform
              for the study of such multi-stage decisions. In many instances,
              the strategy applied to each decision, such as the speed-accuracy
              trade-off, ought to depend on the accuracy of the previous
              decisions. However, as the accuracy of each decision is often
              unknown to the decision maker, we hypothesized that subjects may

              affect subsequent decisions. Subjects made two perceptual

              We found that subjects adjusted their speed-accuracy setting by
              elevating the termination bound on the second decision in

  author   = "van den Berg, Ronald and Yoo, Aspen H and Ma, Wei Ji",
  abstract = "Although visual working memory (VWM) has been studied
              extensively, it is unknown how people form confidence judgments
              about their memories. Peirce (1878) speculated that Fechner's
              law-which states that sensation is proportional to the logarithm
              of stimulus intensity-might apply to confidence reports. Based on
              this idea, we hypothesize that humans map the precision of their
              VWM contents to a confidence rating through Fechner's law. We
              incorporate this hypothesis into the best available model of VWM
              encoding and fit it to data from a delayed-estimation experiment.
              The model provides an excellent account of human confidence
              rating distributions as well as the relation between performance
              and confidence. Moreover, the best-fitting mapping in a model
              with a highly flexible mapping closely resembles the logarithmic
              mapping, suggesting that no alternative mapping exists that
              accounts better for the data than Fechner's law. We propose a
              neural implementation of the model and find that this model also
              fits the behavioral data well. Furthermore, we find that jointly
              fitting memory errors and confidence ratings boosts the power to
              distinguish previously proposed VWM encoding models by a factor
              of 5.99 compared to fitting only memory errors. Finally, we show
              that Fechner's law also accounts for metacognitive judgments in a
              word recognition memory task, which is a first indication that it
              may be a general law in metacognition. Our work presents the
              first model to jointly account for errors and confidence ratings
              in VWM and could lay the groundwork for understanding the
              computational mechanisms of metacognition. (PsycINFO Database
